    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is another recipe given to me by my mom. It is for a simple avocado salsa that goes pretty well with carne asada.</p>
    <p>It tastes really good. Another good thing about it is you can make it as spicy as you want and it is flavorful no matter the spice level.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Avocado</li>
        <li>1 Green tomato</li>
        <li>A small bunch of cilantro</li>
        <li>3-5 serrano peppers</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Lime</li>
        <li>Sparkling Water(optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Cut the serrano peppers in half and add those into the blender. The amount depends on how spicy you want.</li>
        <li>2. Add in the cilantro.</li>
        <li>3. Add in the avocado.</li>
        <li>4. Once you have the ingredients in the blender. Add a small amount of regular water, just enough to cover the bottom of the blender, and blend everything together.</li>
        <li>5. Once everything is blended, pour into a container and add the lime juice to help prevent the sauce from turning a darker green color. You can also add some sparkling water to help prevent it from browning.</li>
